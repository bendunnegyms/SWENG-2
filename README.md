## Software Engineering Year 3 

## Python is the language I'm comfortable with, Golang I picked up because it is quite similar to C

#### Chilling like a villin on git hub dot com

### Python tests
#### Run `pytest lcapy.py` in directory - might need to pip install pytest if not installed already.

### Golang tests
#### Run `go test` in the directory.
#### Unlike Python implementation, the Go one has another file called `lca_test.go` specifically for testing purposes.
